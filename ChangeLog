	  better; Increasing .wcs.max_skip will help in this case - but
	  also increase running time.
	Introduced a "flipped field" parameter that will make the initial
	  wcs "flipped". A field where N is up and W is right has normal
	  orientation. If N is down and W is right, we have a "flipped"
	  field (CDELT1 and CDELT2 have opposing signs).
	Fixed a bug causing an obscure crash in obslist (introduced with the
	  change in end return value from next_token in 0.4.5).
	Changes in camera and telescope control dialog: we have slew limits 
	  (N, E, S, W) to be able to prevent german mounts from meridian-flipping
	  on obscript gotos. 
	Buttons in telescope control to generate sync/additional align commands.
	Added "abort" buttons that stop an ongoing telescope slew.
	Added the display of hour angle and airmass in the obs page of the 
	  camera/telescope control dialog.

0.4.6
	Fixed the camera comm bug introduced in 0.4.5.
		
0.4.5
	Went over the parameter names and changed a few for brevity. Hopefully for the 
	  last time, as this means that some old rc files cannot be read anymore.
	Removed all warnings from gsc.
	Added the option to include catalog objects in generated recipies and
	  convert them to standards.
	Fixed some points in ccd_frame.c and photometry.c where older versions of gcc
	  would give an error.
	Changed the example data.

0.4.4
	Load Tycho2 stars;
	Handle magnitudes without qualifiers;
	Fix the situation when we don't have the standard mags 
	  we want to reduce against (by no longer reporting stars);
	Command-line option to modify parameters for a given run;
	Report converter to tabular format;
	DMS format now handles any separator between d, m and s (including space);
	Fixed a few memory leaks
	Will calculate airmass from time and observer location.
	Changed the save format for .gcxrc in a compatible way (all the
	  entries how have their full path). Removed a segfault that appeared
	  when reading a malformed .gcxrc file.
	
0.4.3
	New dialog to edit/check the wcs;
	New dialog to create recipy files interactively;
	Read/write new style recipy files;
	Rationalised star types;
	Recipy conversion batch command;
	Moved "load recipy" to file menu;
	Loads gsc2 field stars (will load the stars from a file downloaded from
	http://www-gsss.stsci.edu/support/data_access.htm)
	
0.4.2

	gcx now stays in a proper source tree, with ./configure and all that. Also
	has some bug fixes. New features:

	* can run photometry recipy files;
	* new observation script commands;
	* can run an obscript directly from the command line 
	  (no need to click);
	* path searching for obs and rcp files;
	* a little bit of online help;
	* work on the manual has started.

0.2.1

	This is a major rewrite of the interface to cx, now using gtk+. Also, the
	camera control code has been moved to a separate process (cpxctrl).

	new features include:

	* can read gsc field stars and search edb files for objects;
	* can match gsc start positions to sources in ccd frames to obtain
	  true world coordinates
	  * controls lx200 telescopes;
	  * can run observations scripts.

CX_EDB_DIR to point to the gsc directory (gsc must be a subdirectory of the
one pointed to by CX_EDB_DIR). Edb format files for various other objects will 
be searched from this directory too (see ccd/edb.c for more details).

Command-line image processing options still call old-style x11 functions from x11ops. 
These are just leftovers from the last version, and will be replaced - most likely they 
don't work; in the meantime, use cx 0.1.0 for image calibration/stacking.

=====================
Readme for v0.1.0 (cx)

This is the cx program, that controls cpx3m cameras.

To build, run make in the toplevel directory, then make install, 
which copies the binary to /usr/local/bin, and makes it setuid root.

cx can be used in two modes: in interactive mode (invoked by
cx -i) it can control a cpx3m camera and acquire images. Type help 
at the prompt for the available commands.

Images are brought up for display into windows. One can adjust the way
the images are displayed by issuing key commands while the focus is on 
the image window. A summary of the available key commads can be obtained
by pressing F1.

In batch mode, cx can do ccd reductions (dark/flat), bad pixel corrections,
image stacking, combining and alignment, and run photometry on series of images.
Batch commands can be shown by running cx without arguments.

The program consists of the following parts:
============================================

libccd (in the ccd directory) contains code for
handling image frames, reading/writing fits files, searching
image frames for stars and doing aperture photometry.

libnut contains code for matching star positions on the frames
with catalogs, to aid in identifying objects.

libgsc is a slightly modified version of the code supplied
with the gsc catalog, used to browse GSC for catalog stars.

The main program (sources in the toplevel directory) does the
actual camera control and image display.

The Future of cx.
=================

Cx is being rewritten and will be called gcx in future releases.
gcx has many improvements, the most important being:

* uses gtk for a more consistent user interface.
* the camera control code is being moved to a separate
  program, which connects to gcx via tcp-ip. This way,
  gcx doesn;t need to run setuid root, and we can support
  more cameras. 
* gcx supports field identification at the telescope, and
  can help with pointing problems.
